# Ticket Lottery
## Problem ID: lottery

You and your friends are in New York and are planning to go see a Broadway
musical. Unfortunately, New York being New York, the tickets are just a tiny
bit expensive. But one of the shows has a ticket lottery each night where
impecunious people such as you have a chance to win the right to buy slightly
less expensive tickets to good seats. The lottery operates as follows. First,
everyone interested enters the lottery. Then, n lucky winners are drawn, and
each of these is offered to buy up to t tickets.

Given the number of people p in your group (all of which entered the lottery)
and the total number of people m that entered the lottery, what is the
probability that you will be able to get tickets for your entire group? Assume
that the n lucky winners are chosen uniformly at random from the m people that
entered the lottery, and that each person can win at most once.

### Input
The input consists of a single line containing four integers:

`1 <= m <= 1000`: the total number of people who entered the lottery.
`1 <= n <= m`: the total number of winners drawn.
`1 <= t <= 100`: the number of tickets each winner is allowed to buy.
`1 <= p <= m`: the number of people in your group.

### Output
Output a single line containing the probability that your entire group can get
tickets to the show. This probability should be given with an absolute error of
at most 10^-9.
